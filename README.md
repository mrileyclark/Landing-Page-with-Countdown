## How It's Made: 

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Landing Page with Countdown -  Developed a dynamic countdown timer component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to track the time remaining until a specified launch date. The countdown timer displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds in real-time, updating every second to provide users with accurate and precise information. This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development, including DOM manipulation and time/date calculations.

 ## Lessons Learned: 

🎸 I plan on revisting the app to change the sytling of the countdown UI to look like records.
